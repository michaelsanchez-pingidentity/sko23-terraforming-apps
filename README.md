# SKO2023-Terraform-Advanced

 Terraform for the SKO Terraform Advanced session

## Packaging

This repo contains all the necessary code to both configure and demonstrate a single Use Case of an application integration.

Everything needed for this is contained in this repo:

`/terraform` -- contains the HCL to deploy everything
`/app` -- contains the application source and Dockerfile used to demonstrate the configuration

### Terraform

The HCL contains resources for PingOne and for k8s. K8s is used to deploy the application image with an associated Ingress to allow browser access to the container.

#### Providers

The Terraform here uses multiple providers:

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **PingOne** | PingOne Environment \ Services configuration |
| **Kubernetes** | Configure k8s infrastructure components |

#### Terraform Resources

This is what the HCL will create

| Provider | Resource | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PingOne | Environment | Contains all the P1 configuration for the app |
| PingOne | Application | OIDC App used by the app |
| PingOne | Resource Grant | Assigns resources \ scopes to the OIDC App |



#### Variables

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file with the following:

```hcl
region = "{{ NorthAmerica | Canada | Asia | Europe }}"
organization_id = "{{orgId}}"
admin_env_id = "{{adminEnvId}}"
admin_user_id = "{{adminUserId}}"
worker_id = "{{workerId}}"
worker_secret = "{{workerSecret}}"
env_name = "SKO2023 - BXRTerraform"
k8s_deploy_name = "{{Name used for K8s deployment}}"
k8s_namespace = "{{k8s namespace}}"
k8s_domain_name="ping-devops.com"
proxy_image_name="docker.io/pricecs/ping-integration-proxy:0.0.6"
app_image_name="gcr.io/ping-gte/bxrterraform:231201-0.8"
env_type = "dev"
```

#### Deployment

At a command line:

```zsh
terraform init
terraform plan
```

If the plan fails - check your `terraform.tfvars` values. 

If the plan succeeds:

```hcl
terraform apply â€”auto-approve
````
